## Divyanshu Sharma

:wave: Hey there, I'm Divyanshu (He/Him). I'm a computers student at Manipal University Jaipur. I am passionate about coding and always ready to learn new tech! :robot:

Currently just exploring on what particular domains I like.

### Currently learning:

:sparkling_heart: Kotlin: I've been using Java for a while and Kotlin just feels like a natural upgrade. Enjoying it.

:floppy_disk: HTML5 / CSS3: CSS is not easy. No further arguments.

:cloud: JavaScript: This one is probably going to take few years.

:boom: React: Yeah.

:computer: Operating Systems: Reading through Modern Operating Systems by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos.
